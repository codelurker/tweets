1. Introduction

Tweets is a command-line client for Twitter.com written in Python. It supports
viewing a user's friends timeline, user timelines, and updating a user's status.
It outputs this data neatly, and stores account information for updating 
without having to enter a username and password each time.

2. Dependencies

Tweets is written in Python, so you must have Python installed in order to use
it. Tweets also requires the simplejson module for Python, for parsing the
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data that Twitter.com returns. This module is
available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson and is included in the
standard library of Python 2.6. It is also available through package managers 
such as Portage and MacPorts.

3. Usage

Using Tweets is simple. To view a user's timeline:
$ tweets -l xyzuser
Where xyzuser is a username whose timeline you would like to view.

To view your friends timeline:
$ tweets -u myusername -p mypassword -l
Where myusername and mypassword correspond to the username and password for
your account on Twitter.com. This will store your account information in 
~/.tweetsrc

To update your status:
$ tweets 'Writing the README file for tweets'
Note that using double quotes will allow shell expansion of $, !, and other
special characters, so in most cases, single quotes are preferable.
